# Mockingbird: Elevate Your Development Workflow

Welcome to Mockingbird - Mockingbird is an innovative tool designed for developers who require a flexible and efficient way to simulate server environments. It allows for instant mock server creation, streamlining the development process by enabling front-end testing without the need for a fully implemented back-end. With robust middleware functionality, Mockingbird offers real-time insights into server requests, facilitating on-the-fly adjustments and troubleshooting. Integrated seamlessly with Git, it supports collaborative workflows, version control, and configuration management. Developers can test multiple scenarios by switching between various responses for a given route, enhancing the application's reliability. The inclusion of presets optimizes common tasks, saving time and effort. Additionally, Mockingbird's capability to handle multiple servers and projects makes it an indispensable tool for developers handling complex or numerous applications, fostering productivity and innovation in the development cycle.

## Quick start
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/ozkeisar/mockingbird/releases) and download the app.

### Prerequisites:

1.  Ensure you have Mockingbird installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Here](https://github.com/ozkeisar/mockingbird/releases).
    
 2.  Make sure you have a Git installed on you machine (you can download git [Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).
 
 3.  Make sure you have a Git account and the necessary permissions to clone repositories from your Git server.
    

### Steps:

1.  **Launch Mockingbird:**
    
    -   Open Mockingbird on your system. You can find it in your applications folder or search for it in your system's search bar.

 
3.  **Create New Repository (If Necessary):**
    
    -   if you dont have a data repository exist, go to your git server and create new repository
    - once the repository is initialized you can clone it using Mockingbird 

2.  **Clone existing data repository:**
    
    -   **ssh clone** if you have ssh configured in your machine you can just copy the ssh clone url of your repository and clone using the ssh option
    - **https clone** if you dont have ssh configured or you prefer clone using https, you can do so in the https tab, insert username and password and copy the https clone url 
    - **press clone**, mockingbird will clone your data repository and will let you start manage your mocks


Congratulations! You have successfully cloned repository data using Mockingbird. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to refer to the help documentation or reach out to our support team for assistance. Thank you for using Mockingbird!

## What is Mockingbird?

Mockingbird is a revolutionary tool designed for developers, by developers. It's your secret weapon for creating mock servers that mimic real server behavior, seamlessly intercepting requests and providing instant responses. Think of it as your trusty middleware companion, sitting between your application and the server, ready to empower you every step of the way.

## Why Mockingbird?

### 1. Eliminate Idle Time
No more twiddling your thumbs while waiting for the server to catch up. With Mockingbird, you can keep coding and testing without skipping a beat. Say hello to continuous productivity!

### 2. Unleash Integration Power
Who needs to wait for the actual server? Mockingbird lets you simulate server responses on the fly, empowering you to test integrations, debug, and refine your code without any delays. It's integration testing on steroids!

### 3. Gain Unrivaled Visibility
With Mockingbird's middleware magic, you get an eagle-eye view of every single request passing through. Say goodbye to guesswork and hello to full transparency. See it, intercept it, master it!

### 4. Handle Missing Endpoints Like a Pro
Got calls to make before the endpoints even exist? No problem! Mockingbird lets you add mock responses for yet-to-be-developed endpoints, ensuring your calls never fall flat. Smooth sailing all the way!

### 5. Collaborate Effortlessly
Forget about discrepancies between team members. With Mockingbird, everyone's on the same page, working with a shared mock server that mirrors reality. Collaboration has never been easier or more efficient!



## Key Features


### 1. Instant Mock Server Creation

Mockingbird allows developers to create mock servers instantly, without having to wait for the actual server to be developed. This means you can start coding and testing immediately, accelerating your development cycle.

### 2. Middleware Functionality

Experience unprecedented visibility into the requests passing through your server with Mockingbird's powerful middleware functionality. See all requests in real-time and add mocks on the fly, ensuring smooth integration and troubleshooting.

### 3. Git Integration

With support for Git, Mockingbird ensures secure and manageable mock server configurations. Collaborate seamlessly with your team, track changes, and maintain version control with ease.

### 4. Multiple Responses per Route

Easily switch between multiple responses per route with Mockingbird. Test various scenarios and edge cases effortlessly, ensuring robustness and reliability in your applications.

### 5. Presets for Efficiency

Save time and effort with Mockingbird's preset feature. Predefine the active response for multiple routes, streamlining your workflow and increasing productivity.

### 6. Support for Multiple Servers and Projects

Mockingbird supports multiple servers with different endpoints, as well as multiple projects. Whether you're working on a single application or managing multiple projects simultaneously, Mockingbird has you covered.

## Use Cases

### 1. Rapid Prototyping

Quickly prototype your ideas without waiting for backend development. Mockingbird lets you create mock servers instantly, allowing you to iterate and experiment with different features and functionalities.

### 2. Frontend Development

Empower frontend developers to work independently of backend dependencies. With Mockingbird, frontend teams can create and manage mock servers, enabling parallel development and faster time-to-market.

### 3. Integration Testing

Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend systems with Mockingbird's middleware functionality. Monitor requests in real-time, add mocks as needed, and test edge cases with ease, all within a controlled environment.

###   4. API Development

Mockingbird simplifies API development by allowing developers to create mock servers that mimic the behavior of the actual backend. This enables frontend and backend teams to work in parallel, reducing development time and accelerating the delivery of API endpoints.

### 5. Offline Development

Developing in offline or low-connectivity environments can be challenging, especially when relying on external services or APIs. With Mockingbird, developers can create mock servers that simulate the behavior of external dependencies, enabling uninterrupted development even without internet access.

### 6. Load Testing

Mockingbird facilitates load testing by providing the ability to simulate various responses and scenarios. Developers can configure mock servers to return different responses based on factors like request frequency or load, allowing them to test the resilience and scalability of their applications under different conditions.

### 7. Training and Education

Mockingbird can be a valuable tool for training purposes, allowing developers to learn and practice API integration and troubleshooting in a controlled environment. By simulating real-world scenarios and responses, Mockingbird helps developers gain hands-on experience without impacting production systems.
